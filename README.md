# Projects
While opening each folder (Deep_Learning, K Nearest Neighbours, Naive_Baiyes, RGBD Image processing, SVM Kernels).
â€¢Download the zips, place all the files in a folder and run the .py files

Deep Learning: 
	to run: Deep learning module.pu
KNN:
	to run: python_KNN.py

Naive Bayes:
	to run: Naive Bayes gender classifier

SVM Kernels:
	to run: SVM_kernel.py

RGDB Image processing:
	This code is used to find points of contrast using an Xbox Kinect. Helps in analyzing motion of surfaces when subjected to external forces.




Additional projects coded in google collab sheets:
Data set is imported from Kaggle and contains 3.5 million records consisting of accident data of vehicles between the period 2016 to 2020 in the United States of America. 

The analysis helps us to find the optimal dataset which can be used to predict the severity of accidents based on attributes like location, environmental factors and more. Please find the collab sheets for the code below.


Vehicle accident analysis collab sheets (This code can take a lot of time to process)

Compiled code for analysis using machine learning algorithms to predict accident severity based on accident data from 2016 to 2020 in the United States.
